      3 years ago, I realized that I had a dream - I wanted to build something
      important and significant on my own. I wasn't sure whether I was ready,
      but I decided to quit my dream job at

      - a search engine and price comparison website for books and ebooks. I
      found people who decided to help me.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the limited resources that we had, I was sure that the effectiveness
      of our work would be crucial for whole project. I wanted to build
      something, what at the same time could:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>prove that my product is better than existing solutions</li>
      <li>persuade a lot of users that this project is cool and useful</li>
      <li>help me find investors for faster growth</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>I was sure</strong> that I understood what
      <em>Minimum Viable Product</em> is - <strong>I was wrong!</strong>
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-title">This seems to be straightforward, right?</h3>
    <p>Let's start with a definition. The first one is very simple:</p>

    <Quote>
      A Minimum Viable Product is the smallest thing you can build that delivers
      customer value
    </Quote>

      The second definition is from Eric Ries, an entrepreneur and author of The
      Lean Startup, which

    <Quote>
      The minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a
      team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers
      with the least effort.
    </Quote>

    <p>
      Those two definitions suggest that your first version of a product - which
      will help you test your idea - should be as simple as possible and at the
      same time should provide users maximum customer value. There is some
      problem with those definitions -
      <strong>they suggest, that you have to build something</strong>, but the
      truth is that at the beginning
      <strong>you should avoid building a product at all</strong>, because you
      can and you should test your idea without that.

      If you want to be a business owner, then you should be at the same time
      very skeptical and very optimistic. You should be prepared for the worse,
      but you should hope for the best. Skepticism is important because you
      should test your every assumption that you can make money on something,
      but optimism is needed to find a way to prove that your skepticism was
      <strong>in this particular case</strong> unnecessary.

      idea with at least one technique described there.
    </p>
    <h3>Minimum Viable <strong>Business</strong> - first, MVP - later</h3>
    <p>
      MVB is a new term. For me it is helpful because it helps me split the idea
      of building a company into: "research &amp; planning" - MVB and "actual
      implementation" - MVP. I am a software developer, and most of the projects
      I've started because I wanted to learn something about programming in the
      process of doing that - how to implement this functionality, how to use
      that library, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be a great outcome, if one of my projects just took off, and
      became very successful. But this would assume, that I had really great
      idea in first place, and that I had implemented this flawlessly - sadly
      this scenario is very unlikely to happen. You don't know what the market
      wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Businesses are not born <em>automagically</em>.</strong> If you
      focus on building a product, you can build one, even a great one... but
      this does not necessarily mean that you will be able to earn anything from
      that. If at some point you will decide to create a business, then you have
      to start thinking as a business owner, not like a developer, who loves to
      learn new things.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you know the product which you want to build, you will need funding or
      a business to be able to exist and grow. Then before building a product
      you should focus on building a business. Don't get me wrong - this doesn't
      mean that you have to create a company. You should focus on validation,
      whether your business actually has a chance to be a successful business or
      at least will be able to support the development of a solution which your
      product is supposed to solve.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-title">
      Being sure that there is demand for a product like yours
    </h3>
    <p>
      <img
        :src="img('vr-640.png')"
        :srcset="`${img('vr-640.png')} 1x, ${img('vr-700.png')} 2x`"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of our startup I was sure that there is demand a for a price
      comparison website like ours. Why did I think so? Because just in Poland I
      already have 4 competitors, which like me, focused on a niche - books and
      ebooks. According to me, each of them were doing great, but I was sure
      that I could do something better.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have to admit, I didn't conduct proper research. I didn't check exactly
      how many customers they have, and I didn't even try to ask them about
      their profits. I was sure that if someone else is doing this, they have to
      be earning some money from that. That wouldn't make much sense if that not
      were true, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 90's a lot of companies were sure that Virtual Reality (VR) is the
      future. The giants like Nintendo, Atari, Sega invested tons of money in VR
      because their competitors were doing the same. No one wanted to be left
      behind. Even right now, we are not 100% sure that there is demand for VR,
      which companies can offer to customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, before you invest most of your assets in the development of your
      product, check one more time whether there is demand for that, and whether
      your product will be able to make money for own development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then and only then, you can start thinking about how to build the first
      minimal version of your product - which one more time, will confirm that
      your assumptions wereactually correct. Do you see the pattern?
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-title">What MVP is not</h3>
    <p>
      <img :src="img('whatMVPisNot.gif')" alt="what MVP is not" />
    </p>
    <p>
      I can agree that it is necessary in the process of creating an MVP to
      discuss the importance of particular features. Some teams that try to
      prepare an MVP, after a lot of time spent on arguing about which features
      are worth to include or exclude from their
      <em>minimum viable product</em>, having such list defined, finally decide
      to start building a product.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few problems with this approach. First of all, MVP is not a
      strict plan for the first few months of development. It is also not a list
      of chopped out features, and for sure it's not a demo with a bunch of cool
      features which would present how awesome your project is.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-title">
      MVP is more like a process, which can save your business

    <p>But how can one single MVB or MVP do so much? The truth is, it can't!</p>
    <h4 class="section-subtitle">No Market Need</h4>
    <p>
      It is extraordinary that as many as 42% of startups fail because of a
      wrong assumption at the beginning. Inexperienced founders have a tendency
      toward wishful thinking. They are so sure that their idea is good that
      they tend to ignore a need to do a proper research.
    </p>
    <Quote>
      MVB/MVP tests are designed not just to answer technical questions about
      the product, but also to test fundamental business hypotheses about the
      viability of the market it exists in.
    </Quote>
    <p>
      MVB as a cure for the "no market need" problem should be like a bait - it
      should check how many users your product will be able to attract. Not only
      that, you also have to be sure that those users are your target (with
      specific needs and funds that they are willing to spent on things that
      your product can provide).
    </p>
    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Ran Out of Cash</h4>
    <p>
      This also happened to us. Right now I think that
      <em>running out of cash</em> is always an
      <em>outcome, not a reason</em> itself.

      I wasted too much time on the development of things that were not crucial,
      and spent too little time on features that could help us monetize a
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em

        features that should not have even existed in the first version of our
        product.</em

      I decided that to outperform our competitors we were going to integrate
      more bookstores than others. Because of that we needed to spend:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>much more time on integration of those bookstores</li>
      <li>much more time on performance optimization</li>
      <li>
        much more money on servers that were needed to handle updates from those
        bookstores
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="section-subtitle">
      Get Outcompeted, Poor product, Ignore Customers
    </h4>
    <p>
      If your startup was outcompeted, probably you did something wrong. Of
      course, you can always say that your opponent had the "first move
      advantage", but that would be an excuse only in case that either of you
      did not make any mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should not try to build a perfect product just at the beginning. If
      this is even possible, for sure it is too expensive. Most mistakes can be
      corrected, so success at the end depends on speed, performance, and good
      research about things which are not perfect. In all this cases to make
      progress you need to work closely with your customer. You should make your
      product iterations as short as possible, and after each iteration, you
      should check feedback from your users.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means, that you should have a separate MVP of each feature! Even if
      you think that you already know, that specific feature is needed and
      desired by customers, you should first implement a small part of it - 20%,
      and at the same time try to bring 80% of feature value to the table.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-title">MVP is different for each industry</h3>
    <p>
      I think one explanation for why there is so much confusion with MVP is
      that it looks quite different for different companies.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      If you want to build a great restaurant, it is obvious that a location in
      the city center can be too expensive at the beginning. Antique furniture
      probably will also be out of your reach. It is a better idea, to start
      with something smaller. In theory, a food truck could be ideal, but I
      would recommend something smaller, like inviting your friends for a
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you are a software developer, you don't want to rebuild your
      product over and over again from scratch. You want to start with a
      foundation...
    </p>
    <h4 class="section-subtitle">MVP for software developers</h4>
    <p>
      First of all, if you are a programmer, that means that you are probably a
      very technical person. Even if your target market is other programmers,
      who can understand the meaning of returned errors, you should make your
      MVP reliable and usable.

    <p>
      You have to remember that there is still a very high probability that your
      users actually need something slightly different than you initially had in
      mind. This means that you have to be flexible, and, more importantly, your
      <strong>code also has to be flexible</strong>!
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not argue that each project should be covered by unittest with a
      100% rate, but if you are wondering
      <strong>how to build a flexible code</strong>, unittests are the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each software has some kind of core. In most cases this is the most
      complicated part of the system, where a lot of optimization and tweaks
      will be added later. Your core does not have to and in fact should not be
      perfect, but you should cover all cases handled by your code with
      unittests. Only with a bunch of well-written unittests you will be able to
      completely rewrite you code to meet new business criteria... without
      destroying everything in the process.

    <p>
      MVP, in theory, is an easy concept, but in practice, it is extremely
      difficult to master. We want to take action and build great products! It
      is very hard to convince ourselves that we should initially research more
      because we are afraid of giving up on our initial idea while admitting to
      all those naysayers that they were right.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the truth is, your idea didn't came from nothing. You are a deep well
      of experience and unique knowledge. Even if, by your research, you realize
      that your idea business is not possible, you gain ever more unique
      knowledge that your competitors will not have. But if you are able to
      listen to what smart people say about your product, even if your initial
      idea was terrible, you will find out what you will have to do to make
      their life better. Don't be afraid to find the right wall, especially
      after learning about tool which will help you find it.
